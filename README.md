# Loss-Function-Comparison-on-MNIST-Dataset
 This Python project compares the performance of two loss functions, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy, using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates model training, evaluation, and visualizes the loss differences to highlight the impact of each loss function.
